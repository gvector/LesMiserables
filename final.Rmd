```

# Data
The data is about characters in Victor Hugo's book Les Miserables and it is taken from GitHub ([https://github.com/MADStudioNU/lesmiserables-character-network/tree/master](URL)). The data is composed by two files which will name "nodes" and "edges". 

```{r upload, message=FALSE}
nodes <- read_csv("jean-complete-node.csv")
head(nodes)
edges <- read_csv("jean-complete-edge.csv")
head(edges)
```
From the above chunk we see that the dataset nodes has 181 nodes with 3 columns:
- Id: the id of the character 
- Label: the full name of the character 
- Description: details on the character 

While the dataset edges has 1589 and 5 columns:
- Source: 
- Target
- Type: it's undirected for every character
- Id
- Label: the chapter in which the character appeared 

For simplicity reasons, we will rename the columns "Source" and "Target" of the dataset into "from" and "to" respectively. 
```{r}
nodes <- nodes %>%
  rename("id" = "Id",
         "label" = "Label")

edges <- edges %>% 
        rename("from" = "Source",
               "to" = "Target")
```

## Check NAs
Before starting the analysis we need to check for Nas and in case remove them. 
```{r check for NA}
table(is.na(edges))

which(is.na(edges))
edges[1097,]

edges <- na.omit(edges)
table(is.na(edges))
```

## Check for duplicate interactions in the dataset

We now check if there are duplicate interactions between characters.
To do so we create a new dataframe from the already existing dataframe "edges" and group by the columns "from" and "to"; then we count the number of unique IDs.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
multiple_edges <- edges %>%
  group_by(from, to) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  group_by(from, to) %>%
  filter(n > 1)

multiple_edges
```
## Merge with edges
We now merge the dataframes "edges" and "multiple_edges" in order to include the count of interactions between characters, making sure to take the distinct count of each interaction. 
```{r}
merged_edges <- edges %>%
  left_join(multiple_edges, by = c("from", "to")) %>%
  mutate(n = ifelse(is.na(n), 1, n)) %>%
  distinct(from, to, .keep_all = TRUE)

merged_edges
```
The above dataframe is the one we'll use for our analysis. 

# Transform the dataframe into graphs
For visualization purposes we'll transform into graph both the "edges" dataframe (which contains duplicate interactions), but this will not be then used for following analyis. Moreover we'll transofrm into a weighted graph the "merged_edges" dataframe. The weights of each edge will be based on the number of interactions between the characters. 

```{r}
# graph with duplicate interactions
g <- graph_from_data_frame(edges, directed = FALSE)

# graph without duplicate interactions, but weighted 
g_w <- graph_from_data_frame(merged_edges, directed=FALSE)

# Set the weights of the edges based on the 'n' column
E(g_w)$weight <- merged_edges$n
```

```{r}
hist(E(g_w)$weight, breaks = 25,
     xlab= "Weights", main="Edges' weight distribution")
```

## Plots of graphs
The following is the plot of the multiedged graph:
```{r, cache=TRUE}
vis_g <- toVisNetworkData(g)

visNetwork(
  nodes = vis_g$nodes,
  edges = vis_g$edges,
  width = "100%",
  height = '600px'
)
```

The following is the single-edges, but weighted graph:
```{r, cache=TRUE}
vis_g_w <- toVisNetworkData(g_w)

visNetwork(
  nodes = vis_g_w$nodes,
  edges = vis_g_w$edges,
  width = "100%",
  height = '600px'
)
```

# Analysis 

We now proceed with our analysis looking at degree distribution, betweeness, strength and transitivity. 
## Degree table and histogram
```{r}
# degree of each vertex
table(degree(g_w))
hist(degree(g_w), breaks = 50, ylim = c(0,110), 
     xlab= "Degree",main = "Histogram of degree")
```
The code degree(g_w) calculates the degree of each vertex in the graph, more in details the degree of a vertex in a graph represents the number of edges connected to that vertex.
From the above chunk we see that the highest degree is 87, while there are most of the edges that have degree from 1 to 7. 

## Transitivity 
```{r}
t <- transitivity(g_w)
t
```
In general, transitivity refers to the measure of the likelihood that two vertices connected to a common neighbor are also connected to each other. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of triangles in a graph to the number of "open triads.", where a triad is a set of three vertices, and an open triad is a triad where at least one edge is missing.
In this case, we have a transitivity value of 0.2894354 suggests a moderate level of clustering in the graph.

## Strength
```{r}
s <- graph.strength(g_w)
hist(s,breaks = 30, ylim = c(0,130), main= "Histogram of Strength",
     xlab= "Strength")
```
The code graph.strength(g_w) calculates the strength of each vertex in the graph, more in details the strength of a vertex in a graph is a measure of the sum of weights of the edges connected to that vertex. Hence, this measure is particularly useful when working with weighted graphs, which is the case of out graph where , as a remark, the weights of the edges are given by the count of the interactions between characters. 

## Betweeness
```{r}
b <- betweenness(g_w)
hist(b,breaks = 30, main= "Histogram of Betweeness",
     xlab= "Betweeness")
```
The code betweenness(g_w) calculates the betweenness centrality of each vertex in the graph, more in details betweenness centrality is a measure of how central or influential a vertex is in a graph based on the concept of shortest paths. In general, vertices with higher betweenness are considered more central in the network as they tend to lie on a higher number of shortest paths between other pairs of vertices.

## Betweeness and Strength
```{r}
plot(s, b, ylab="Betweeness", xlab= "Strength")
```
The above scatter plot shows the relationship between the vertex strengths and their betweenness centrality in the graph. Each point on the plot represents a vertex, and its position corresponds to the strength and betweenness centrality values of that vertex.
In general, vertices with higher strength values tend to have higher or lower betweenness centrality, indicating whether more influential vertices also tend to have stronger connections in the graph. 
In this case, we see that there is a particular observation having high strength and high betweeness, suggesting that that particular point might be an important character. 
Hence, we now investigate on who are the important actors in our network. 

## Important actor
```{r}
ia <- order(b, decreasing=T)[1]

name <- names(which.max(b))

name_out <- nodes[nodes$id == name, ][2, 2]

namename <- name_out$label

cat('The important actor is',namename,'\n')
```

## Degree distribution
We now look at the degree distribution:
```{r}
degree_dist <- function(graph) {
  fd <- table(degree(graph))
  d <- as.numeric(names(fd)) + 1 
  list(d = d, fd = fd)
}

dd <- degree_dist(g_w)

dd$fd # frequency, sum to 180

# Plot
with(dd, plot(log(d), log(fd)))
```
The degree_dist function calculates the degree distribution of the graph, which means it computes the frequency distribution of the degrees (number of edges incident to each vertex) in the graph and it then returns a list with two elements: the degree values and their corresponding frequency counts.
We then plot and visualize the degree distribution in logarithmic scales, more specifically to check if the degree distribution follows a power-law pattern.
In this case *??????????*

# Models

## Linear Model
```{r}
mod0 <- lm(log(fd) ~ log(d), data=dd)
cat('model with the fd transformed:', '\n')
summary(mod0)
```
From the above result of the linear model we have that the estimated intercept value is 4.0667, which represents the expected log-transformed frequency when the log-transformed degree is zero. The estimated coefficient for the log of the degree is -1.1670, which indicates the expected change in the log-transformed frequency for a one-unit increase in the log-transformed degree.

## Generalized Linear Model
```{r}
mod1 <- glm(fd ~ log(d), family = poisson, data=dd)
cat('model without the fd transformed:', '\n')
summary(mod1)
```

### Plot
```{r}
with(dd, plot(log(d),log(fd)))
abline(a=mod0$coef[1],b=mod0$coef[2], col='red')
abline(a=mod1$coef[1],b=mod1$coef[2], col='blue')
```

## ERGM model
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ergm)
am <- get.adjacency(g_w, sparse = FALSE)
g_ergm <-as.network(am, directed = FALSE)
ergm(g_ergm~edges) %>% summary
```

# Clustering
We now perform some clustering analysis using different methods such as fast greedy algorithm, edge betweenness clustering algorithm, and Louvain community detection algorithm. Furthermore, we'll also look at the modularity scores which quantifies the quality of the community structure within the network. 

## Cluster by greedy optimization of modularity

```{r}
g_kc <- graph_from_data_frame(merged_edges, directed=FALSE)
kc <- cluster_fast_greedy(g_kc)
```

In general, cluster_fast_greedy() function partitions the graph into communities based on the connectivity patterns between vertices and it aims to find a division of the graph that maximizes the modularity score. The resulting communities represent groups of vertices that are more densely connected within their own group compared to connections between different groups.

```{r}
l_kc <- length(kc)
cat('The number of clusters by greedy optimization of modularity are',l_kc,'\n')
mod_kc <- modularity(kc)
cat('The modularity coefficient is',mod_kc,'\n')
```
```{r}
table(membership(kc))
```

We now plot the  clustering method based on the fast greedy algorithm:
```{r}
set.seed(123456)

V(g_kc)$community <- kc$membership

colors <- adjustcolor(col = c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "#4b0082", "violet"), alpha=1)

plot(kc, g_kc, vertex.size=5, , vertex.color=colors[V(g_kc)$community], vertex.label=NA, asp=.5)
```

```{r}
# dendrogram based on kc
par(cex=.4)
plot_dendrogram(kc, mode = 'hclust', colbar=c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "#4b0082", "violet"))
```

## Cluster by Edge betweenness (Newman-Girvan)
```{r}
g_ceb <- graph_from_data_frame(merged_edges, directed=FALSE)
ceb <- cluster_edge_betweenness(g_ceb) 
```

In general, the edge betweenness algorithm works by iteratively removing edges with the highest betweenness centrality and as edges are removed, the graph is divided into communities based on the remaining connected components. This process continues until all edges are removed, resulting in a hierarchical structure of communities.

```{r}
l_ceb <- length(ceb)
cat('The number of clusters by greedy optimization of modularity are',l_ceb,'\n')
mod_ceb <- modularity(ceb)
cat('The modularity coefficient is',mod_ceb,'\n')
```

```{r}
table(membership(ceb))
```
We now plot the clustering method based on edge betweenness algorithm:
```{r}
# Plotting the histogram
hist(membership(ceb), breaks = 30, xlab= "Clusters", main= "")
```

```{r}
set.seed(1)

V(g_ceb)$community <- ceb$membership

plot(ceb, g_ceb, vertex.size=5, vertex.label=NA, asp=.5)
```

```{r}
dendPlot(ceb, cex= .4)
```

## Hieragichal Clustering

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Louvain Comunity Detection
g_hc <- graph_from_data_frame(merged_edges, directed=FALSE)
cluster <- cluster_louvain(g_hc)

cluster_df <- data.frame(as.list(membership(cluster)))
cluster_df <- as.data.frame(t(cluster_df))
cluster_df$id <- rownames(cluster_df)

# Create group column
nodes <- left_join(nodes, cluster_df, by = "id")
colnames(nodes)[4] <- "group"
```

In general, the Louvain algorithm is a widely used and efficient method for community detection in networks. It optimizes the modularity of the network by iteratively moving vertices between communities to increase the modularity score. The algorithm starts with each vertex in its own community and iteratively merges communities to maximize modularity.

```{r}
mod_hc <- modularity(cluster)
cat('The modularity coefficient is',mod_hc,'\n')
```

We now plot the clustering method based on the Louvain algorithm:
```{r}
plot(cluster, g_hc, vertex.size=5, vertex.label=NA, asp=.5)
```
```{r}
table(membership(cluster))
```
